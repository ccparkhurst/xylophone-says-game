# Xylophone Says! Project
## Overview

This game uses the same logic as the classic children's game Simon Says, but with a xylophone rather than a Simon console.

Upon loading the site, users are able play the xylophone in "free play mode" by clicking on the keys. To play a game of Simon, the user clicks on the xylophone mallet to begin the game. The computer will flash a key and play the corresponding note, and the user must then mimic the computer by clicking on the same key. The computer will then go again, this time adding one new note to the sequence. If the user correctly mimics the computer, the computer will go again, building on the sequence. This continues until the user erroneously clicks on the wrong key. When this happens, the score will reset to 0 and the user must click the xylophone mallet to begin a new game.
